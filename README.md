A [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) overlay containing various medical imaging packages which have not been merged to [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).
A Git commit of this repository and of the upstream package set gives you a declarative way to completely specify your software dependencies down to base C libraries.
Some HPC systems now provide Nix, and many other support Singularity containers, which you can build from a Nix derivation.

See [the manual](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#chap-overlays) for usage instructions.

We may in future include a standard package set for medical imaging.

We welcome contributions including packages and bug reports.
